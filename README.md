# Hi, I’m Kev. 👋

At day, I work as Frontend Engineer in [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)’s Engineering Productivity team! (Note that this is my private account.)

At night, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, such as [furryli.st](https://github.com/strideynet/bsky-furry-feed) 🐕 or my projects over at [codingpaws](https://gitlab.com/codingpaws) 🐾, listen to music, or play video games with friends.

I enjoy designing and building software products that are meaning- and useful to the world — all with a passion for engineering productivity, no-bullshit business practices, and spending time with the people I love. 🧡
